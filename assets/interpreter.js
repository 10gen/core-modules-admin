    // Strip strings and regexps
    /* OK, so, when checking for [](){}, first strip regexps and quotes.

       "...." and '....' go away.
       "...\"..." go away. So do '...\'...' and '..."...'.

       We don't care what happens in the place of these strings; we're
       not doing any syntax analysis. For the time being, replace them with
       the empty string.

       /.../[gim] has to go away.

       Be careful of 12 / 1 + [ 1 / 12 ].

       Also, watch out (as usual) for /..\/../.

       A regular expression can't begin after a number or identifier. So we
       could just look for a pair of slashes and then afterwards post-process
       them to skip any that start after a digit or letter.. except that
       there's no way to get the locations of the matches. So..

       /(\d|\w)\s*\// -> "$"

       HA HA HA

       /\/.*\\\// -> "/$"

       THIS IS HOW WE DO SOPHISTICATED SYNTAX ANALYSIS IN JS

       /\/.+\// -> ""
